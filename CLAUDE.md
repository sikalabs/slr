# New Command
- when you add a new command, see the cmd/example/example.go to see how to do it
- use underscores in the package name, not dashes (e.g. s3_backups_cleanup, not s3-backups-cleanup)

# Git
- do NOT add Generated with Claude Code to the commit message, you can keep the claude as co-author
- keep commit messages simple
