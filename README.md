# slr: SikaLabs Random Utils

`slr` is very similar tool to `slu` ([sikalabs/slu](https://github.com/sikalabs/slu)) but it's for random stuff that doesn't fit into `slu`. We dont want to put random hacks to `slu` so we created `slr` to be able to easily distribute our random scripts, tools and utils.

If something is useful for more cases we will move it to `slu`.

## Install

```
slu install-any-bin -n slr -u https://github.com/sikalabs/slr/releases/download/v0.1.0/slr_v0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
